When digitizing physical documents for storage, accessibility, or processing, hardware scanners are often preferred. Dynamsoftâ€™s Dynamic Web TWAIN is a popular choice for web application integration.

However, when scanners are impractical, mobile device cameras can be effective alternatives. Mobile Web Capture (MWC) is an SDK designed for this purpose.
